                <p>Din Djarin, also known as "the Mandalorian" or simply "Mando," was a human male Mandalorian warrior during the era of the New Republic. With his Mandalorian armor, IB-94 blaster pistol, Amban sniper rifle, and distinctive beskar helmet, Djarin was both well-equipped and enigmatic—a stranger whose past was shrouded in mystery to others.</p>

                    As a child, Din Djarin resided in a village on the planet Aq Vetina. The village came under attack by Separatist battle droids at some point during the Fall of the Republic, and Djarin was caught in the crossfire. While the droids slaughtered the people of the village, his mother and father hid him under a hatch before being killed in an explosion themselves shortly after. The hatch was then opened by a B2-series super battle droid, which attempted to fire on the child. Before it could, however, the battle droid was destroyed by a Mandalorian warrior wearing the symbol of Clan Vizsla.

                    As more Mandalorians arrived and fought the remaining battle droids, the warrior flew away using his jetpack while carrying Djarin, rescuing him. He was then taken in as a foundling by the Mandalorians, who trained him in the Fighting Corps and took care of him. By the time following the Great Purge of Mandalore, he was part of the Tribe, which operated on the planet Nevarro, and acquired Mandalorian armor.

                    Unknown to Djarin, the Tribe followed the orthodox ways of the Children of the Watch. Due to this, once he had received his helmet, he ceased to remove it in front of anyone else, for if he did, he would not be allowed to put it back on again or be considered a true Mandalorian, which was a tradition practiced by the members of the Children of the Watch.

                    Keeping his past a secret, Djarin worked as a bounty hunter when he became an adult, rising to prominence in the years following the fall of the Galactic Empire. He became known simply as "the Mandalorian," or "Mando" for short, to those outside of the Tribe. The Razor Crest—an ST-70 military patrol starship that predated the Imperial Era—served as his personal transport.

            <p>Djarin was a warrior who initially wore a set of durasteel Mandalorian armor utilizing pieces made from beskar, which included a shoulder pauldron, helmet, and heartplate. The bounty hunter began replacing some of the damaged armor pieces with his payment of beskar from the Client; eventually, he achieved a full beskar body suit of a helmet, plated vest, two pauldrons (one bearing his signet, the mudhorn), two vambraces, two gauntlets, two greaves, and two boots.</p>
